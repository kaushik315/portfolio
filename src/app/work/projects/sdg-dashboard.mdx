## Overview

A comprehensive SDG dashboard web application developed for Edinburgh Napier University to highlight and track their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) efforts. The application combines interactive data visualization, content management, and a chatbot interface to enhance accessibility and engagement.

## Key Features

- **Modern UI/UX**: Built a clean, accessible, and responsive front-end using Next.js and a modular component structure.
- **Content Management**: Integrated a headless CMS to allow content updates without developer intervention.
- **SEO Optimization**: Applied technical SEO best practices to ensure visibility and discoverability.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Developed a chatbot using Google DialogFlow to allow users to explore SDG-related data conversationally.
- **Team Collaboration**: Led a multi-role team, ensuring clear task delegation, communication, and integration of deliverables into a unified product.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For server-rendered, high-performance web application development.
- **Google DialogFlow**: For building the conversational chatbot interface.


## Challenges and Learnings

The most significant challenge was in leading a cross-functional team and coordinating the various moving parts—frontend, chatbot development, and content integration—into a cohesive and functioning system. This experience sharpened leadership skills, especially in:

- Task delegation and prioritization.
- Managing asynchronous collaboration.
- Synthesizing diverse technical contributions into a meaningful, user-focused outcome.

Additionally, integrating DialogFlow with a modern Next.js application involved careful handling of APIs, state, and conversational flow logic.

## Outcome

The project culminated in a fully functional, user-friendly platform that presents SDG efforts in a visually engaging and accessible manner. It improved internal awareness of SDG initiatives and provided a centralized tool for students and staff to interact with university data. The project was positively received and demonstrated the value of combining technical implementation with thoughtful leadership.

## Overview

As Treasurer for the Napier Mountain Biking Club (NMTB), I am responsible for managing the club’s finances and ensuring transparent budgeting for all events and activities throughout the academic year. The role involves overseeing spending, preparing financial reports, and coordinating with other committee members to support the club’s growing community of riders.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Financial Oversight**: Manage all incoming and outgoing funds, maintaining accurate financial records for transparency and audits.
- **Budgeting and Planning**: Work closely with the club president and events coordinator to allocate budgets for trips, training sessions, and maintenance.
- **Sponsorship and Funding**: Assist in securing sponsorships and university grants to fund club initiatives and events.
- **Reporting and Communication**: Provide regular financial updates to the club members and committee, ensuring accountability and informed decision-making.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets**: For maintaining detailed budgets and financial planning.
- **University Financial Portals**: For grant applications and expense tracking.


## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge has been managing fluctuating expenses across different activities while ensuring fair resource allocation. The experience has strengthened my organizational skills and improved my ability to communicate financial concepts clearly to non-financial stakeholders.

## Outcome

Under my financial leadership, the club has seen more structured planning for trips and activities, resulting in better use of funds and increased member engagement. The role has provided me with valuable experience in financial stewardship and team collaboration—skills that are transferable to both technical and non-technical leadership roles.

This experience reflects my ability to take initiative, manage resources efficiently, and support team dynamics beyond the scope of technical development.

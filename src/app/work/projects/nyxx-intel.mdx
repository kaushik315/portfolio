## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a Threat Intelligence Solution to protect organizations from today's complex and evolving cyber threats.

## Key Features

- **Tool Tip to Gather information**: The tool tip scrapes the internet for any new information on cyber threats and provides informations to take necessary steps to avert it.
- **Continuous Sync**: The internet is constantly monitored for any new form of threat to organizations
- **Scalable System**: The system is designed in a manner to constantly adapt and incorporate new features to find and detect new threats
- **User Friendly Web Application**: Developed a User Friendly and interactive Web Application to present Threat Intelligence information to the client


## Technologies Used

- **OpenCTI**: For scraping the internet and obtaining any potentional cyber threats.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenge was integration of data received from OpenCTI and making it into a readiable manner and  presenting it to the client

## Outcome

Currently we are in the process of intergrating OpenCTI and the Web Application
